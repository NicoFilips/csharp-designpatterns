Creational design patterns are a category of design patterns in software engineering that deal with object creation mechanisms. These patterns aim to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation, enhancing flexibility and reuse of existing code. Creational patterns often hide the specifics of object creation from the client, making the system more independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. The primary focus is on encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses and hiding how instances of these classes are created and combined. This category includes patterns like Singleton, Builder, Prototype, Factory Method, and Abstract Factory. Each of these patterns solves different issues related to object creation, ranging from creating a single instance of a class to creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
