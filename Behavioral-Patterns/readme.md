Behavioral design patterns are a group within the design patterns that are primarily concerned with the assignment of responsibilities between objects and how they communicate and interact with each other. They focus on how objects distribute work, the algorithms they use, and the flow of control between them. Unlike structural patterns that establish a simple way to build relationships between entities, behavioral patterns deal with the efficient and safe distribution of behaviors among the objects of a system.
The essence of a behavioral pattern is to define the best practices for object interaction and responsibility sharing in a way that increases flexibility in carrying out communication and the delegation of responsibilities. These patterns help in defining how and when objects should interact, in addition to the manner in which they provide their functionalities.
Behavioral patterns often encapsulate complex control logic that's hard to follow at run-time, making the system easier to understand and manage. They can also help to minimize tight coupling and improve the division of responsibilities among objects, which enhances code reusability and scalability.
By focusing on how objects fulfill their roles within an application's operations, behavioral patterns provide vital mechanisms for defining how objects interact in a way that boosts the system's flexibility and efficiency in executing its tasks. They are essential for designing highly cohesive systems that encapsulate intricate flows of control and data among objects.
