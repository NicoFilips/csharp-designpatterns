Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns in software engineering that focus on how classes and objects can be composed to form larger structures. These patterns facilitate the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities. Structural patterns help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do the same, thereby promoting flexibility and efficiency in the design.
The key goal of structural patterns is to ensure that changes in the system can be made easily by composing objects or classes into larger structures. They use inheritance and composition to extend or alter the functionality of objects or classes.
Common structural patterns include:
Structural patterns are about creating larger structures from individual parts in a flexible and efficient manner, promoting scalability and system maintenance.
