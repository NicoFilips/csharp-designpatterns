## About the Repository 📖

This repository is a comprehensive collection of design pattern examples in C#. It's intended for developers looking to deepen their understanding of design patterns and apply them in real-world software development. The patterns covered include Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns, providing a wide range of solutions to common software design challenges.

## Features 🚀

- **Creational Patterns** 🏭: Explore factory methods, abstract factories, singleton, builder, and prototype patterns with C# examples.
- **Structural Patterns** 🌉: Dive into adapter, composite, proxy, flyweight, facade, bridge, and decorator patterns.
- **Behavioral Patterns** 🧠: Learn through observer, strategy, command, iterator, mediator, memento, and state pattern examples.
- **Interactive Examples** 💡: Each pattern is demonstrated with fully interactive C# code examples.
- **Comprehensive Documentation** 📄: Detailed comments and explanations are provided for each example to ensure understanding.
- **Community Contributions** 👥: A collaborative space for developers to share improvements and new pattern examples.

## Getting Started 🏁

Clone the repository and explore the examples within. Each design pattern is contained in its separate directory with a README explaining its purpose, usage, and example code.
